# 📈 Website Traffic Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting website traffic using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical website traffic data, the goal is to build predictive models that can anticipate future page visits. Accurate forecasts can support marketing campaigns, server load planning, and strategic decision-making.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Website Traffic Forecasting.ipynb`: The core notebook where data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation are performed.
- Data (loaded within the notebook): Time series data representing website traffic.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data cleaning and transformation for time series modeling.
- Visualization of traffic patterns and trends.
- Use of time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet.
- Model evaluation and forecast visualization.

## 🛠 Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/website-traffic-forecasting.git
cd website-traffic-forecasting
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not available, install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels jupyter
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `Website Traffic Forecasting.ipynb` and follow the code cells sequentially.

## 📊 Example Output

- Time series plots
- Forecast vs actual comparisons
- Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE)

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `jupyter`
